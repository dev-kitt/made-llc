          Hey I'm Keith, but here you can call me Kitt - Keith Is Testing Things, also I Keep IT Testing, or Keith Is Tasting Tacos, but mainly because of <a href="https://youtu.be/7qQ2dvSvT_M" >this</a>.  
          As a former Army Parachute Rigger, having been selected for the Airborne Special Operations Parachute Test Facility, and as a current Test Automation Engineer and Quality Assurance Expert 
          working in cutting edge technologies, I have spent the last 13 years specializing in the art of testing.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          In a previous life I was even an aspiring stand-up comedian (<a href="https://youtu.be/cex2SMMODbQ" >proof</a>) ... although judging by this website I may think I still am. Although I have taken a different path than most, 
          one far less traveled, what I have come to realize over the course of my long and weathered journey, is just how uniquely and unconventionally valuable my journey has been. 
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Currently I spend my days automating front-end, back-end, and API tests for one of crypto's largest fintech platforms. By night, I'm brushing up on new technologies in Machine Learning, AI, AR/VR, and Computer Vision; using Python, Flutter/Dart, 
          Node/React, Angular - and of course, testing with Cypress, WebDriver, Python3, and AndroidStudio. Also I feed my kids and wife in between. 
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Outside of moonlighting as a Developer, Designer and Dad ... I can also say I have skydived with the Golden Knights, driven a submarine, am a 2x 2022 Smartbear Quarterly Community Leader, 2022 Smartbear Community Hero Nominee (TBA), 2018 Google Nesties Award Winner ðŸ˜‰, 
          Auburn University Football walk-on (and off), HS Wrestling All-American - 2x State Champion and 1x Runner-Up, 2x HS Football State Champion, and 1996 Harriet the Spy Nickelodeon Contest Runner-Up. OK that last one is a reach, but this is my website so I can brag on myself how I want.
          <br></br>

          <small>**This is my personal portfolio website, developed by me, under my company Made, LLC. Please do not and use any of this content or my personal information maliciously. There is a reason my face is covered by a unicorn head and why I don't have any social media accounts,
            and I sure as heck don't own one of those Roomba vacuums - they're just expensive and we bought Omaha Steak instead.  All's I'm sayin' is, we are all living on a rock flying through space doing the best we can with what we have - Don't be an @$$!
